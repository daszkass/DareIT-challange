## TASK 1
#### Subtask 1
`9/10`
#### Subtask 3
I have decided to participate in this challange, because I liked the idea of creating portfolio during the course. I already had theoretical knowledge in manual testing field, but I was looking for opportunity to challenge myself in practical area. 

I hope this course will help me build strong practical skills and give me an extra advantage, while I will be looking for new, dream job.
